# [Chris Swan home page](https://chris.swanz.net/)

Home page using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) with [Hallo theme](https://themes.gohugo.io/hallo-hugo/) (in [source branch](https://github.com/cpswan/cpswan.github.io/tree/source))

To get theme in place after cloning:
`git submodule init && git submodule update`

## Automation

There's a GitHub Action [HugoBuild.yml](.github/workflows/HugoBuild.yml) that runs when changes are
pushed to the source branch.
